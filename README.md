# Natural-Scene-Simulation

## BRIEF DESCRIPTION
The simulation of natural scenes is
a very important branch of
Computer Graphics and has
broad application fields. The main
idea is to simulate a real-world
natural scene, by drawing island,
trees, grass and simulate the
daylight, water movement and
surround the world with a realistic
skybox and some special effects
**like:** fog, snow falling, â€¦ etc.
